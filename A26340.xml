            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WARNING to the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; <hi>London</hi> in particular.</head>
            <p>OH! conſider, I beſeech you, how long the Lord hath waited upon you in his Tender Mercy, becauſe he would not have you periſh in your Sins, and ſo your Souls come to periſh eternally. Conſider how many Warnings he hath ſent, and yet you have not taken Warning; but run on in Sin, Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms, Swearing, Curſing, Lying and all manner of Sports &amp; Playes, and ſpending your precious Time in Vanity, not conſidering your End, and the Preciouſneſs of your Never dying Souls, that muſt live to all Eternity, either in eternal Bliſs and Happineſs, or in Eternal Wo and Miſery.</p>
            <p>Oh! how hath the Lord ſignified his ſore Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt this Nation and <hi>London,</hi> in ſending forth his Plagues and Peſtilence, Sword, Fire (and Famine hath been alſo threatned) in which Judgments Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were cut off? Oh! what little notice is taken of theſe things, ſo as to amend your Lives? Oh! conſider what will be the End of this, if you do not Repent with Speed: Do you not know your Lives are compared to very ſmall things, even a Bubble in the Water, which is ſoon up and ſoon down; and to a Weaver's Shuttle, that ſoon is ſhut; to a Thred,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38185:3"/>that is ſoon ſnapped aſſunder. When the Senſe of the Shortneſs of Man and Woman's Life have been ſet before me, it hath made me tremble, and with Pity have I beheld what a great Buſle Men make to get a little periſhing Things in this World; when all is done, it is but Vanity and a Lye, even all your Pride, Pomp and Vain-glory; and your Souls in this ſtate ſtand in Danger of Everlaſting Ruin: Oh! that you would conſider it well, before the Thred of your Lives be ſnapt aſſunder; and conſider the many Sins that are committed in one day, and ſuch as are of a ſcarlet dye, as, grievous Oaths, Blaſphemies and Lying is very frequent with many people in their Buying and Selling, which none can do who abide in the true Fear of God; and it is plainly ſaid in the Scriptures of Truth. <hi>Thoſe who love and make a Lye, ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Then what do you think will become of your poor Immortal Souls, when this Life is ended, and all your Jolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is at an End? Oh! that you would but enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſerious Conſideration, and think within your ſelves, <hi>If God ſhould take away my Life this Night, or this Hour, what will become of my Soul?</hi> We ſee daily how that many paſs away, and do not return again: ſo it muſt be with us, and we cannot reſiſt the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Lord. Therefore hearken to the Voice of the Lord, for thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your Wayes; ask, and you ſhall have; ſeek, and you ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you: for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that ſeeks truly and ſincerely, findeth; he that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, receiveth; and him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38185:3"/>unto him: for the Lord giveth liberally, and upbraideth not, if thou wilt but Repent, and forſake thy Sins, that would ruin thy Soul.</hi> Therefore good is the Lord, who would not have any to periſh, but would have all to come unto him, and be ſaved: For this End he hath ſent forth his Servants to preach the Everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is the Power of God, to preſerve thee from Sin, if thou wilt obey the Motions of his Grace, even in thy Heart, which ſhews thee thou ſhouldſt not be drunk, Swear, Lye nor Defraud any, but <hi>do to all as thou wouldſt they ſhould do to thee:</hi> So this is the Will of the Lord, even our Sanctification, to be waſhed in the Water of Regeneration; and he hath promiſed, <hi>They who Repent, and forſake Sin, ſhall find Mercy.</hi> And the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all Sin thoſe who do obey his ſpiritual Light, which ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in their Hearts, and reproves them for Sin; for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him we can do nothing.</hi> So Life and Death is ſet before all people, that they may chuſe Life, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vain Pleaſures and Death; and my Soul's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that People may chuſe Holineſs, and live. <hi>For, without Holineſs none can ſee the Lord;</hi> and if we cannot ſee him, how ſhall we live with him forever? for <hi>No Unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> And ſo, as we turn to the Lord, he will turn his Judgments from this Nation, which otherwiſe he hath determined to bring upon this Nation and <hi>London,</hi> by reaſon of Sin: For, often I have been waked out of Sleep with Sorrow and Pain upon my Heart, my Spirit being under a Senſe and Burden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe things; it lay upon me to declare the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38185:4"/>
               <hi>Judgments of the Lord,</hi> as it hath been ſignified to me by Viſions; and it hath laid with very much weight upon my Spirit, Night and Day concerning theſe things, That <hi>unleſs you Repent, the Lord will ſend yet more Plagues, Suddain Deaths, and other Miſeries, and Great Mortalities.</hi> When <hi>Jonah</hi> warned the King and People of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> they did not Beat him, and put him in Priſon; but they Repented, and the Lord beheld it, and he had Mercy, and turned away his Judgments: And ſo he will do to this Nation, if you will Repent, and Turn from your Sins, and do the things that be Juſt; for the Lord is an All ſeeing God, you cannot do any Sin in the ſecret place but he ſees it, whether it be in Thought, Word or Deed. And thus in Mercy he firſt ſends his Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before his Judgments, and if ye will take War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he will ſend Mercy, and not Judgment; for to that End he ſent forth his Servants, to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to the Power of the Living God.</p>
